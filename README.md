# Spotify-Ad-Block

Spotify ads are unpleasant, so here's a JavaScript Snippet which mutes Spotify when an ad pops up.  
In order to remove those pesky ads, all we need to do is setup our Code Snippet on your favourite browser.

### Create a Snippet
1. Open the Snippets pane.
2. Click New snippet.
3. Enter a name for your Snippet then press Enter to save.
4. Use the Code Editor to add [JavaScript](https://github.com/abhijeetpandit7/Spotify-Ad-Block/blob/main/SpotifyAdBlock.js) to your Snippet.
5. When there's an asterisk next to the name of your Snippet it means you have unsaved code. Press Control+S or Command+S (Mac) to save.

### Running Snippet
1. Switch your browser tab to [Spotify - Web Player](https://open.spotify.com/)
2. Open the Snippets pane.
3. Click the name of the Snippet that you want to run. The Snippet opens in the Code Editor.
4. Click Run Snippet, or press Control+Enter or Command+Enter (Mac).

There you go. No more wind rushing by, no horns nor any engines.
